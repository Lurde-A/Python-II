  4. Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file how_many_lines.txt. Store that file object in the variable lines_doc.
//
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
  5. Iterate through each of the lines in lines_doc.readlines() using a for loop. Inside the for loop print out each line of how_many_lines.txt.
//
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
  for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)
