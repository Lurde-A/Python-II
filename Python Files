                      READIN A FILE

  1. Use with to open the file welcome.txt. Save the file object as text_file.
//
with open('filename.txt') as file_object:
  2. Read the contents of text_file and save the results in text_data.
//
with open('welcome.txt') as text_file:
  text_data = text_file.read()
  3. Print out text_data.
//
ith open('welcome.txt') as text_file:
  text_data = text_file.read()
  print(text_data)

                      ITERATING THROUGH LINES

  4. Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file how_many_lines.txt. Store that file object in the variable lines_doc.
//
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
  5. Iterate through each of the lines in lines_doc.readlines() using a for loop. Inside the for loop print out each line of how_many_lines.txt.
//
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
  for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)

                      READING A LINE

  6. Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file just_the_first.txt. Store that file object in the variable first_line_doc.
//
with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  7. Save the first line of just_the_first.txt into the variable first_line.
//
with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  8. Print out the variable first_line.
//
with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  print(first_line)

                      WRITING A FILE

  9. Create a file object for the file bad_bands.txt using the open() function with the w argument. Assign this object to the temporary variable bad_bands_doc.
//
with open('bad_bands.txt', 'w') as bad_bands_doc:
  10. Use the bad_bands_doc.write() method to add the name of a musical group you dislike to the document bad_bands.
//
with open('bad_bands.txt', 'w') as bad_bands_doc:
  bad_bands_doc.write("Bunke")

                      APPENDING TO A FILE

  11. We’ve got a file, cool_dogs.txt, filled with all the cool dogs we know. Somehow while compiling this list we forgot about one very cool dog. Let’s fix that problem by adding him 
to our cool_dogs.txt.
Open up our file cool_dogs.txt in append-mode and assign it to the file object cool_dogs_file.
//
with open('cool_dogs.txt', 'a') as cool_dogs_file:
  12. Inside your with block, add “Air Buddy\n” to cool_dogs.txt. Air Buddy is a Golden Retriever that plays basketball, which more than qualifies him for this list. 
The \n character moves to the next line after appending the string.
//
with open('cool_dogs.txt', 'a') as cool_dogs_file:
  cool_dogs_file.write('Air Buddy\n')

                      WHAT'S WITH "WITH"

  13. In script.py there’s a file object that doesn’t get closed correctly. Let’s fix it by changing the syntax! Remove this line:
close_this_file = open('fun_file.txt')
And change it to use the with syntax from our previous exercises. Remember to indent the rest of the body so that we don’t get an IndentError.
                                                GIVEN:   close_this_file = open('fun_file.txt')
                                                         setup = close_this_file.readline()
                                                         punchline = close_this_file.readline()
                                                         print(setup)
//
with open('fun_file.txt') as close_this_file:
  setup = close_this_file.readline()
  punchline = close_this_file.readline()
  print(setup)

                      WHAT IS CSV FILE?

  14. CSV files are just plain text files! Open logger.csv using our standard with syntax, saving the file object in the temporary variable log_csv_file.
//
with open('logger.csv') as log_csv_file:
  15. Print out the contents of logger.csv by calling .read() on the file. Notice that it is parsed as a string.
//
with open('logger.csv') as log_csv_file:
  print(log_csv_file.read())

                      READING A CSV FILE

  16. Import the csv module.
//
import csv
  17. Open up the file cool_csv.csv in the temporary variable cool_csv_file.
//
import csv
with open('cool_csv.csv') as cool_csv_file:
  18. Using csv.DictReader read the contents of cool_csv_file into a new variable called cool_csv_dict.
//
import csv
with open('cool_csv.csv') as cool_csv_file:
  cool_csv_dict = csv.DictReader(cool_csv_file)
  19. cool_csv.csv includes a cool fact about every person in the CSV. For each row in cool_csv_dict print out that row’s "Cool Fact".
//
import csv
with open('cool_csv.csv') as cool_csv_file:
  cool_csv_dict = csv.DictReader(cool_csv_file)
  for row in cool_csv_dict:
    print(row['Cool Fact'])

                      READING DIFFERENT TYPES OF CSV FILES
