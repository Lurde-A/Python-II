                      CREATE A DATAFRAME I

  1. You run an online clothing store called Panda’s Wardrobe. You need a DataFrame containing information about your products.
Create a DataFrame with the following data that your inventory manager sent you:
Product ID	Product Name	Color
1	          t-shirt	      blue
2	          t-shirt      	green
3	          skirt	        red
4	          skirt	        black
We have already filled in the information for Product ID in df1. Add the code to create the columns Product Name and Color and their associated data.
//
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
  'Product ID': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Product Name': ['t-shirt', 't-shirt', 'skirt', 'skirt'], 'Color': ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'black']
  })
print(df1)

                      CREATE A DATAFRAME II

  2. You’re running a chain of pita shops called Pita Power. You want to create a DataFrame with information on your different store locations.
Use a list of lists to create a DataFrame with the following data:
Store ID	Location	    Number of Employees
1	        San Diego	    100
2	        Los Angeles	  120
3	        San Francisco	90
4	        Sacramento  	115
We have filled in the information for the first two rows in df2. Add the code to create the 3rd and 4th rows, and the column names.
//
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
df2 = pd.DataFrame([
  [1, 'San Diego', 100],
  [2, 'Los Angeles', 120],
  [3, 'San Francisco', 90],
  [4, 'Sacramento', 115]],
  columns=['Store ID', 'Location', 'Number of Employees'])
print(df2)

                      COMMA SEPARATED VALUES

  3. You run a cupcake store and want to create a record of all of the cupcakes that you offer. Write the following data as a CSV in cupcakes.csv.

  9. The DataFrame df represents data collected by four health clinics run by the same organization. Each row represents a month from January through June and shows the number of 
appointments made at four different clinics.
You want to analyze what’s been happening at the North location. Create a variable called clinic_north that contains ONLY the data from the column clinic_north.
GIVEN: 
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame([
  ['January', 100, 100, 23, 100],
  ['February', 51, 45, 145, 45],
  ['March', 81, 96, 65, 96],
  ['April', 80, 80, 54, 180],
  ['May', 51, 54, 54, 154],
  ['June', 112, 109, 79, 129]],
  columns=['month', 'clinic_east',
           'clinic_north', 'clinic_south',
           'clinic_west'])
//
clinic_north = df.clinic_north

  10. What exactly have you selected? After you create the variable, enter the command:
print(type(clinic_north))
to see what data type you’ve created. How is this different from what you get if you type the following?
print(type(df))
//
clinic_north = df.clinic_north                                              RESULT:<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>

  11. Now, you want to compare visits to the Northern and Southern clinics. Create a variable called clinic_north_south that contains ONLY the data from the columns clinic_north 
and clinic_south.

clinic_north_south = df[['clinic_north', 'clinic_south']]

  12. When we select multiple columns, do we get a Series or a DataFrame? After you’ve created the variable, enter the command:
print(type(clinic_north_south))
to see what data type you’ve created. How is this different from what happened in the previous exercise?
//
clinic_north_south = df[['clinic_north', 'clinic_south']]                                              RESULT:
