                      CREATE A DATAFRAME I

  1. You run an online clothing store called Panda’s Wardrobe. You need a DataFrame containing information about your products.
Create a DataFrame with the following data that your inventory manager sent you:
Product ID	Product Name	Color
1	          t-shirt	      blue
2	          t-shirt      	green
3	          skirt	        red
4	          skirt	        black
We have already filled in the information for Product ID in df1. Add the code to create the columns Product Name and Color and their associated data.
//
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
  'Product ID': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Product Name': ['t-shirt', 't-shirt', 'skirt', 'skirt'], 'Color': ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'black']
  })
print(df1)

                      CREATE A DATAFRAME II

  2. You’re running a chain of pita shops called Pita Power. You want to create a DataFrame with information on your different store locations.
Use a list of lists to create a DataFrame with the following data:
Store ID	Location	    Number of Employees
1	        San Diego	    100
2	        Los Angeles	  120
3	        San Francisco	90
4	        Sacramento  	115
We have filled in the information for the first two rows in df2. Add the code to create the 3rd and 4th rows, and the column names.
//
import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd
df2 = pd.DataFrame([
  [1, 'San Diego', 100],
  [2, 'Los Angeles', 120],
  [3, 'San Francisco', 90],
  [4, 'Sacramento', 115]],
  columns=['Store ID', 'Location', 'Number of Employees'])
print(df2)
