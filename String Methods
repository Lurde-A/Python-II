                            FORMATTING METHODS
  1.1 You’ve been given two strings, the title of a poem and its author, and have been asked to reformat them slightly to fit the conventions of the organization’s database. Make 
poem_title have title case and save it to poem_title_fixed.
      poem_title = "spring storm"
      poem_author = "William Carlos Williams"
//
poem_title_fixed = poem_title.title()

  1.2 Print poem_title and poem_title_fixed. How did the string change?
//
print(poem_title)                                    PRINTED: spring storm
print(poem_title_fixed)                                       Spring Storm

  1.3 The organization’s database also needs the author’s name to be uppercase only. Make poem_author uppercase and save it to poem_author_fixed
//
poem_author_fixed = poem_author.upper()

  1.4 Print poem_author and poem_author_fixed. Again, how did the string change?
//
print(poem_author)                                    PRINTED: William Carlos Williams
print(poem_author_fixed)                                       WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS

                            SPLITTING STRINGS
  2.1 In the code editor is a string of the first line of the poem Spring Storm by William Carlos Williams. Use .split() to create a list called line_one_words that contains each 
word in this line of poetry.
line_one = "The sky has given over"
//
line_one_words = line_one.split()
print(line_one_words)

                            SPLITTING STRINGS II
  3.1 Using .split() and the provided string, create a list called author_names containing each individual author name as it’s own string.
authors = "Audre Lorde,Gabriela Mistral,Jean Toomer,An Qi,Walt Whitman,Shel Silverstein,Carmen Boullosa,Kamala Suraiyya,Langston Hughes,Adrienne Rich,Nikki Giovanni"
//
author_names = authors.split(',')
print(author_names)
  3.2 Create another list called author_last_names that only contains the last names of the poets in the provided string.
//
names = [name.split() for name in author_names]
print(names)
author_last_names = [last_name[-1] for last_name in names]
print(author_last_names)

                            SPLITTING STRINGS III
  4.1 The organization has sent you over the full text for William Carlos Williams poem Spring Storm. They want you to break the poem up into its individual lines. Create a list 
called spring_storm_lines that contains a string for each line of Spring Storm.
      spring_storm_text = \
      """The sky has given over 
      its bitterness. 
      Out of the dark change 
      all day long 
      rain falls and falls 
      as if it would never end. 
      Still the snow keeps 
      its hold on the ground. 
      But water, water 
      from a thousand runnels! 
      It collects swiftly, 
      dappled with black 
      cuts a way for itself 
      through green ice in the gutters. 
      Drop after drop it falls 
      from the withered grass-stems 
      of the overhanging embankment."""
//
spring_storm_lines = spring_storm_text.split('\n')
print(spring_storm_lines)
