                                  MAKING API REQUEST FROM BROWSER

  2. This time, make an API call to request state-level data containing:
      - The NAME variable,
      - The total commuters count, and
      - The count for commuters who travel 90 or more minutes.

                                  CENSUS GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS

  3. Using the browser, make an API call to request state-level data containing the `NAME` variable, the total commuters count, and the count for commuters who travel 
90 or more minutes for only the state of New York. (Click to Toggle Correct Answers).

  4. Make an API call to request the same 3 variables for all counties within the state of New York. Use the for parameter in conjunction with in to request specific geographic regions.

                                  MAKING API REQUEST IN API

  5. Start by importing the requests module.
//
import requests

  6. Make a GET request to the Census API to request county-level data containing
      - the NAME variable,
      - the total commuters count, and
      - the count for commuters who travel 90 or more minutes
      - for all counties
      - within the state of New York.
      - (see the previous exercise for this URL)
Store the response object in a variable called r.
//
import requests
r = requests.get('https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B08303_001E,B08303_013E&for=county:*&in=state:36')

  7. Use the .text attribute to access the returned string data and store it in a variable called r_text. Try printing r_text with the print(___) command.
//
r_text=r.text
print(r.text)

  8. Use the .json() method to access the decoded JSON data and store it in a variable called r_json. Try printing out r_json. Can you see the advantage working with r_json has 
over r_text?
//
r_json=r.json()
print(r_json)

                                  CONVERTING JSON TO CSV

  9. Start by importing the csv module.
//
import csv
