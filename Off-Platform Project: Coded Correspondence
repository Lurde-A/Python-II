    1. You just got a message from your pen pal Vishal!
'Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something 
like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. 
For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would encode my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left with respect to the alphabet. So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my encoded message, "ebiil"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it by shifting each letter 3 places to the right. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer encoded message that you have to decode yourself!
    "xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!"
This message has an offset of 10. Can you decode it?
Use your Python skills to decode Vishal’s message and print the result.
//
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
message = "xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!"
offset = 10
def crack_message(message, offset):
    decrypted_message=""
    for character in message:
        if character in alphabet:
            position = alphabet.find(character)
            new_pos = (position + offset) % 26
            new_char = alphabet[new_pos]
            decrypted_message += new_char
        else:
            decrypted_message += character
    return decrypted_message
print(crack_message(message, offset))

  2. Great job! Now send Vishal back a message using the same offset. Your message can be anything you want! Remember, encoding happens in opposite direction of decoding.
//
message_out = "hey there, thank you for the example - it was worth decoding!"
offset_out = 10
def encrypt_message(message_out, offset_out):
  encrypted_message = ""
  for character_out in message_out:
    if character_out in alphabet:
      position_out = message_out.find(character_out)
      new_position = (position_out - offset_out) % 26
      new_character = alphabet[new_position]
      encrypted_message += new_character
    else:
      encrypted_message += character_out
  return(encrypted_message)
print(message_out)
print(encrypt_message(message_out, offset_out))

  3. Vishal sent over another reply, this time with two coded messages! You're getting the hang of this! Okay here are two more messages, the first one is coded just like before with 
an offset of ten, and it contains a hint for decoding the second message!
        First message:   
            -    jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud.
        Second message:
            -    bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!
Decode both of these messages.
//
message_1 = "jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud."
message_2 = "bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!"
print(crack_message(message_1, offset))                                                           RESULT IN TERMINAL: "the offset for the second message is fourteen."

offset_2 = 14
print(crack_message(message_2, offset_2))                                                         RESULT IN TERMINAL: "performing multiple caesar ciphers to code your messages is even more secure!"

  4. Here's the coded message:        
    "vhfinmxkl atox kxgwxkxw tee hy maxlx hew vbiaxkl hulhexmx. px'ee atox mh kxteer lmxi ni hnk ztfx by px ptgm mh dxxi hnk fxlltzxl ltyx."
Good luck! Decode Vishal’s most recent message and see what it says!
//
message_3 = "vhfinmxkl atox kxgwxkxw tee hy maxlx hew vbiaxkl hulhexmx. px'ee atox mh kxteer lmxi ni hnk ztfx by px ptgm mh dxxi hnk fxlltzxl ltyx."
print(crack_message(message_3, 7))                                                                RESULT IN TERMINAL: "computers have rendered all of these old ciphers obsolete. we'll 
                                                                                                                       have to really step up our game if we want to keep our messages safe."
