Storing patient names and insurance costs

  1. We would like to keep a record of medical patients and their insurance costs.
First, create an empty dictionary called medical_costs.
//
medical_costs = {}

  2. Let’s populate our medical_costs dictionary by adding the following key-value pairs:
- Add "Marina" to medical_costs as a key with a value of 6607.0.
- Add "Vinay" to medical_costs as a key with a value of 3225.0.
//
medical_costs["Marina"] = 6607.0
medical_costs["Vinay"] = 3225.0

  3. Using one line of code, add the following three patients to the medical_costs dictionary:
- "Connie", with an insurance cost of 8886.0
- "Isaac", with an insurance cost of 16444.0
- "Valentina", with an insurance cost of 6420.0
//
medical_costs.update({"Connie": 8886.0, "Isaac": 16444.0, "Valentina": 6420.0})

  4. Print medical_costs. Make sure the dictionary is what you expected.
//
print(medical_costs)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': 6607.0, 'Vinay': 3225.0, 'Connie': 8886.0, 'Isaac': 16444.0, 'Valentina': 6420.0}

  5. You notice that Vinay’s insurance cost was incorrectly inputted. Update the value associated with Vinay to 3325.0.
Print the updated dictionary.
//
medical_costs["Vinay"] = 3325.0
print(medical_costs)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': 6607.0, 'Vinay': 3325.0, 'Connie': 8886.0, 'Isaac': 16444.0, 'Valentina': 6420.0}

  6. Let’s calculate the average medical cost of each patient. Create a variable called total_cost and set it equal to 0. Next, iterate through the values in medical_costs and add each 
value to the total_cost variable.
//
total_cost = 0
for cost in medical_costs.values():
  total_cost += cost
print(total_cost)                                            PRINTED: 41682.0

  7. After the loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the medical_costs dictionary. Print average_cost with the following message:
"Average Insurance Cost: {average_cost}"
//
average_cost = total_cost / len(medical_costs)
print("Average Insurance Cost: "+ str(average_cost))         PRINTED: Average Insurance Cost: 8336.4

  8. You have been asked to create a second dictionary that maps patient names to their ages.
First, create two lists called names and ages with the following data:
names    	  ages
Marina  	  27
Vinay    	  24
Connie  	  43
Isaac	      35
Valentina	  52
//
names = ["Marina", "Vinay", "Connie", "Isaac", "Valentina"]
ages = [27, 24, 43, 25, 52]

  9. Next, create a variable called zipped_ages that is a zipped list of pairs between the names list and the ages list.
//
zipped_ages = zip(names, ages)

  10. Create a dictionary called names_to_ages by using a list comprehension that iterates through zipped_ages and turns each pair into a key : value item.
Print names_to_ages to see the result.
//
names_to_ages = {key: value for key, value in zipped_ages}
print(names_to_ages)                                          PRINTED: {'Marina': 27, 'Vinay': 24, 'Connie': 43, 'Isaac': 25, 'Valentina': 52}

  11. Use .get() to get the value of Marina’s age and store it in a variable called marina_age. Use None as a default value if the key doesn’t exist.
Print marina_age with the following message:
"Marina's age is {marina_age}"
//
marina_age = names_to_ages.get("Marina")
print("Marina's age is "+ str(marina_age))                    PRINTED: Marina's age is 27

  12. Let’s create a third dictionary to represent a database of medical records that contains information such as a patient’s name, age, sex, gender, BMI, number of children, 
smoker status, and insurance cost. First, create an empty dictionary called medical_records.
// 
medical_records={}

  13. Next, add "Marina" to medical_records as a key with the value being a dictionary of medical data:
{"Age": 27, "Sex": "Female", "BMI": 31.1, "Children": 2, "Smoker": "Non-smoker", "Insurance_cost": 6607.0}
//
medical_records={}
medical_records["Marina"] = {"Age": 27, "Sex": "Female", "BMI": 31.1, "Children": 2, "Smoker": "Non-smoker", "Insurance_cost": 6607.0}

  14. Do the same for the following individuals:
Name    	Age	  Sex    	BMI	  Children  	Smoker  	  Insurance Cost
Vinay	    24  	Male	  26.9	0	          Non-smoker	3225.0
Connie  	43  	Female	25.3	3	          Non-smoker	8886.0
Isaac	    35	  Male	  20.6	4	          Smoker	    16444.0
Valentina	52	  Female	18.7	1	          Non-smoker	6420.0
//
medical_records["Vinay"] = {"Age": 24, "Sex": "Male", "BMI": 26.9, "Children": 0, "Smoker": "Non-smoker", "Insurance_cost": 3225.0}
medical_records["Connie"] = {"Age": 43, "Sex": "Female", "BMI": 25.3, "Children": 3, "Smoker": "Non-smoker", "Insurance_cost": 8886.0}
medical_records["Isaac"] = {"Age": 35, "Sex": "Male", "BMI": 20.6, "Children": 4, "Smoker": "Smoker", "Insurance_cost": 16444.0}
medical_records["Valentina"] = {"Age": 52, "Sex": "Female", "BMI": 18.7, "Children": 1, "Smoker": "Non-smoker", "Insurance_cost": 6420.0}

  15. Print medical_records to see the result.
//
print(medical_records)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': {'Age': 27, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 31.1, 'Children': 2, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 6607.0}, 
                                                                        'Vinay': {'Age': 24, 'Sex': 'Male', 'BMI': 26.9, 'Children': 0, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 3225.0}, 
                                                                        'Connie': {'Age': 43, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 25.3, 'Children': 3, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 8886.0}, 
                                                                        'Isaac': {'Age': 35, 'Sex': 'Male', 'BMI': 20.6, 'Children': 4, 'Smoker': 'Smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 16444.0}, 
                                                                        'Valentina': {'Age': 52, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 18.7, 'Children': 1, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 6420.0}}

  16. The medical_records dictionary acts like a database of medical records. Let’s access a specific piece of data in medical_records.
Print out Connie’s insurance cost with the following message:
"Connie's insurance cost is X dollars."
//
print("Connie's insurance cost is " + str(medical_records["Connie"]["Insurance_cost"]) + " dollars.")                  PRINTED: Connie's insurance cost is 8886.0 dollars.

  17. Vinay has moved to a new country and we no longer want to include him in our medical records. Remove Vinay from medical_records.
//
medical_records.pop("Vinay")
print(medical_records)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': {'Age': 27, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 31.1, 'Children': 2, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 6607.0}, 
                                                                        'Connie': {'Age': 43, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 25.3, 'Children': 3, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 8886.0}, 
                                                                        'Isaac': {'Age': 35, 'Sex': 'Male', 'BMI': 20.6, 'Children': 4, 'Smoker': 'Smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 16444.0}, 
                                                                        'Valentina': {'Age': 52, 'Sex': 'Female', 'BMI': 18.7, 'Children': 1, 'Smoker': 'Non-smoker', 'Insurance_cost': 6420.0}}

  18. Let’s take a closer look at each patient’s medical record. Use a for loop to iterate through the items of medical_records. For each key-value pair, print out a string that looks like 
the following:
"{Name} is a {Age} year old {Sex} {Smoker} with a BMI of {BMI} and insurance cost of {Insurance_cost}"
//
for name, record in medical_records.items():
  print(name + " is a " + str(record["Age"]) + " years old " + record["Sex"] + " " + record["Smoker"] + " with a BMI of " + str(record["BMI"]) + " and insurance cost of " 
+ str(record["Insurance_cost"]))                               PRINTED: Marina is a 27 years old Female Non-smoker with a BMI of 31.1 and insurance cost of 6607.0
                                                                        Connie is a 43 years old Female Non-smoker with a BMI of 25.3 and insurance cost of 8886.0
                                                                        Isaac is a 35 years old Male Smoker with a BMI of 20.6 and insurance cost of 16444.0
                                                                        Valentina is a 52 years old Female Non-smoker with a BMI of 18.7 and insurance cost of 6420.0
