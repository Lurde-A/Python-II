Storing patient names and insurance costs

  1. We would like to keep a record of medical patients and their insurance costs.
First, create an empty dictionary called medical_costs.
//
medical_costs = {}

  2. Let’s populate our medical_costs dictionary by adding the following key-value pairs:
- Add "Marina" to medical_costs as a key with a value of 6607.0.
- Add "Vinay" to medical_costs as a key with a value of 3225.0.
//
medical_costs["Marina"] = 6607.0
medical_costs["Vinay"] = 3225.0

  3. Using one line of code, add the following three patients to the medical_costs dictionary:
- "Connie", with an insurance cost of 8886.0
- "Isaac", with an insurance cost of 16444.0
- "Valentina", with an insurance cost of 6420.0
//
medical_costs.update({"Connie": 8886.0, "Isaac": 16444.0, "Valentina": 6420.0})

  4. Print medical_costs. Make sure the dictionary is what you expected.
//
print(medical_costs)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': 6607.0, 'Vinay': 3225.0, 'Connie': 8886.0, 'Isaac': 16444.0, 'Valentina': 6420.0}

  5. You notice that Vinay’s insurance cost was incorrectly inputted. Update the value associated with Vinay to 3325.0.
Print the updated dictionary.
//
medical_costs["Vinay"] = 3325.0
print(medical_costs)                                         PRINTED: {'Marina': 6607.0, 'Vinay': 3325.0, 'Connie': 8886.0, 'Isaac': 16444.0, 'Valentina': 6420.0}

  6. Let’s calculate the average medical cost of each patient. Create a variable called total_cost and set it equal to 0. Next, iterate through the values in medical_costs and add each 
value to the total_cost variable.
//
total_cost = 0
for cost in medical_costs.values():
  total_cost += cost
print(total_cost)                                            PRINTED: 41682.0

  7. After the loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the medical_costs dictionary. Print average_cost with the following message:
"Average Insurance Cost: {average_cost}"
//
average_cost = total_cost / len(medical_costs)
print("Average Insurance Cost: "+ str(average_cost))         PRINTED: Average Insurance Cost: 8336.4
