                                INTRODUTCION TO STRINGS
  1. Save your favorite word as a string to the variable favorite_word.
//
favorite_word = "Potatoe"

  2. Print favorite_word.
//
favorite_word = "Potatoe"
print(favorite_word)

                                THEY'RE ALL LISTS!
  3. One of the most common things that are represented by strings is names. Save your name as a string to the variable my_name.
//
my_name = "Lurde"
  4. Select the first letter of the variable my_name and save it to first_initial.
//
my_name = "Lurde"
first_initial = my_name[0]

                                CUT ME A SLICE OF STRING
  4. A new employee, Rodrigo Villanueva, is starting today and you need to create his account. His first_name and last_name are stored as strings in script.py. Create a variable 
new_account by slicing the first five letters of his last_name. 
      first_name = "Rodrigo"
      last_name = "Villanueva"
//
new_account = last_name[:5]
print(new_account)
  5. Create a variable called temp_password by creating a slice out of the third through sixth letters of last_name. Your string should have a total of 4 characters.
//
temp_password = last_name[2:6]
print(temp_password)

                                CONCATENATING STRINGS
  5. Write a function called account_generator() that takes two inputs, first_name and last_name and concatenates the first three letters of each and then returns the new account name.
      first_name = "Julie"
      last_name = "Blevins"
//
first_name = "Julie"
last_name = "Blevins"
def account_generator(first_name, last_name):
  new_account_name = first_name[:3] + last_name[:3]
  return new_account_name
  6. Test your function on the first_name and last_name provided in script.py and save it to the variable new_account.
//
new_account = account_generator(first_name,last_name)
print(new_account)

                                MORE AND MORE STRING SLICING
  6. Copelandâ€™s Corporate Company also wants to update how they generate temporary passwords for new employees. Write a function called password_generator() that takes two inputs, 
first_name and last_name, and then concatenates the last three letters of each and returns them as a string.
//
first_name = "Reiko"
last_name = "Matsuki"
def password_generator(first_name, last_name):
  pas = first_name[len(first_name)-3:] + last_name[len(last_name)-3:]
  return pas
  7. Test your function on the provided first_name and last_name and save it to the variable temp_password
//
temp_password = password_generator(first_name, last_name)
print(temp_password)
