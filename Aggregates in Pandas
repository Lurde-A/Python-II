  2. Our finance department wants to know the price of the most expensive pair of shoes purchased. Save your answer to the variable most_expensive.
//
most_expensive = orders.price.max()
print(most_expensive)                        RESULT:
                                                        493.0
  3. Our fashion department wants to know how many different colors of shoes we are selling. Save your answer to the variable num_colors.
//
num_colors = orders.shoe_color.nunique()
print(num_colors)                            RESULT:
                                                        5

  4. Let’s return to our orders data from ShoeFly.com. In the previous exercise, our finance department wanted to know the most expensive shoe that we sold. Now, they want to know 
the most expensive shoe for each shoe_type (i.e., the most expensive boot, the most expensive ballet flat, etc.). Save your answer to the variable pricey_shoes.
  5.Examine the object that you just created using:
print(pricey_shoes)
//
pricey_shoes = orders.groupby('shoe_type').price.max()
print(pricey_shoes)                          RESULT:
                                                        shoe_type     price

                                                        stilettos    	468
                                                        wedges	      488
  5. What type of object is pricey_shoes? Enter the following code to check: print(type(pricey_shoes))
//
print(type(pricey_shoes))                   RESULT: 
                                                        <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>

orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')                                  2	stilettos	    468
pricey_shoes = orders.groupby('shoe_type').price.max()              3	wedges	      488
  6. Modify your code from the previous exercise so that it ends with reset_index, which will change pricey_shoes into a DataFrame.
  7. Examine the object that you’ve just created using the following code: print(pricey_shoes)
//
pricey_shoes = orders.groupby('shoe_type').price.max().reset_index()
  8. Now, what type of object is pricey_shoes? Enter the following code to check: print(type(pricey_shoes))
//
print(type(pricey_shoes))                   RESULT: 
                                                        <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

  9. Once more, we’ll return to the data from ShoeFly.com. Our Marketing team says that it’s important to have some affordably priced shoes available for every color of shoe that we sell.
Let’s calculate the 25th percentile for shoe price for each shoe_color to help Marketing decide if we have enough cheap shoes on sale. Save the data to the variable cheap_shoes.
Note: Be sure to use reset_index() at the end of your query so that cheap_shoes is a DataFrame.
  10. Display cheap_shoes using print.
//
orders = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
print(orders.head(10))
cheap_shoes = orders.groupby('shoe_color').price.apply(lambda x: np.percentile(x, 25)).reset_index()
print(cheap_shoes)                   RESULT: 
                                                        shoe_color     price
