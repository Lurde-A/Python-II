  2. Our finance department wants to know the price of the most expensive pair of shoes purchased. Save your answer to the variable most_expensive.
//
most_expensive = orders.price.max()
print(most_expensive)                        RESULT:
                                                        493.0
  3. Our fashion department wants to know how many different colors of shoes we are selling. Save your answer to the variable num_colors.
//
num_colors = orders.shoe_color.nunique()
print(num_colors)                            RESULT:
                                                        5

  4. Let’s return to our orders data from ShoeFly.com. In the previous exercise, our finance department wanted to know the most expensive shoe that we sold. Now, they want to know 
the most expensive shoe for each shoe_type (i.e., the most expensive boot, the most expensive ballet flat, etc.). Save your answer to the variable pricey_shoes.
  5.Examine the object that you just created using:
print(pricey_shoes)
//
pricey_shoes = orders.groupby('shoe_type').price.max()
print(pricey_shoes)                          RESULT:
                                                        shoe_type     price
                                                        ballet flats	498
                                                        sandals      	498

  5. What type of object is pricey_shoes? Enter the following code to check: print(type(pricey_shoes))
//
print(type(pricey_shoes))                   RESULT: 
                                                        <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
